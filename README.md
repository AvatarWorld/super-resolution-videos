# Super resolve videos
Applying SRGAN technique implemented in https://github.com/zsdonghao/SRGAN on videos to super resolve them.

## Motivation
One of the state of the art techniques at the time to super resolve an image involves the SRGAN technique as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf). We want to investigate the effects of trying this technique on videos to see if we can super resolve them without major distortions.

## Implementation
This repository gives you a framework to choose any video within a particular folder and super reolve it by 4x. Our beta code works well for scenic videos, and we'll try thing on faster videos that contain action like soccer/ action movie clips.
